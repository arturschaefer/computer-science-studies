### Single responsibility principle

`A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
`

This principle is based on the fact that a class or module should only be concerned with one aspect of a program, or be responsible for one thing. Requirements change and software evolves all the time. When this happens, classes, modules and functions must reflect that change. The more a class is concerned with, or more responsibilities it had, the more it must be changed.
