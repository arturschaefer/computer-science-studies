### Dependency Inversion Principle

`Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
`

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g. interfaces).
Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions.
