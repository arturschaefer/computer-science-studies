### Liskov Substitution Principle

`If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of that program.
`

Essentially, we should be able to replace any instance of a parent class with that of a child class without anything breaking. When getting started with object-orientated programming, referring to the phrase “is a” to help determine relationships between classes can be helpful. This SOLID Principle helps us ensure we do this properly.
